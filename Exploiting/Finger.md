# Finger



> Finger is some old thingie that allows enumeration of users.  It shows users which are, or have recently logged into the system



Download finger-user-enum from gitthub or pentestmonkey

- to check if can use apt-get

~~~bash
finger-user-enum.pl -U /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -t 1.1.1.1
~~~



or if looking for specific user which may not be in the wordlist



~~~bash
finger-user-enum.pl -u root -t 1.1.1.1
